# Welcome!
Welcome to my website. At the moment, there aren't many things to do, and some sections are incomplete. However, I plan on updating this regularly to showcase my latest projects and acheivements. 

Some of these blog posts will feature my projects, new langauges/frameworks I'm learning, or just my thoughts on random subjects. 

If you're curious, this site is built on React and Gatsby, using other supplemental packages to support the ['chessbook'](../guestbook) and other features as I see fit.

For now, I have to get back to work on this. I'll leave you with a small snippit of Javascript as a teaser :)

## Code block test

```js
const function hello(){
  console.log('hello world!');
}
```
`hello()`
