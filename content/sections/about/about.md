For my entire life, I've had a fascination with the countless ways computers and technology shape our everyday lives. From connecting with people across the globe to creating unique and impossible digital worlds, the possibilities seemed endless. So I decided, when I went to college, to earn my Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2022 and my Master's in 2023. I have since had numerous experiences designing, developing, and deploying software solutions for modern problems.

In many of my professional projects I have taken lead roles, single-handedly communicating with business-end employees, organizing system architecture, implementing solutions, and providing continuous delivery. These projects range from redesigning in-house websites with new databases, web APIs, and features, developing online VR solutions, and inventing new methods to clean and combine massive geographical datasests.

Outside of professional settings, I continuously expand my development knowledge with a variety of passion projects. One of which is this site made using React and Gatsby. Check out the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link" href="/guestbook"><u>guest book</u></a> to see React in action! Using Python 3, I have been continuously developing an administration bot for Telegram that can send invites, save and retrieve chat messages, and send reminders using a fully-custom system. Additionally, .NET has been on my radar, exploring the uses of MAUI and ASP.
